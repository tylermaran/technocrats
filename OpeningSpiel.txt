Q: Who in here was born AFTER 1980?  Congrats, you probably know this already, but you are labeled as the “Millennial Generation”. 
BUT did you also know that 66% or fully 2/3 of Millennials have nothing saved for Retirement?
Zero. Zilch. Nada.
That goes against the song playing in the background… we are not FREE, if we have no money or savings.  A few of us probably still live at home because of this.  This is not FREE, my friends.

To remedy this situation, we introduce:

TECH SQUARE INVESTMENTS – The Bank for New Ideas.

TECH SQUARE INVESTMENTS was built to cater to the banking, trading, and investments needs of the Millennial Generation. TECH SQUARE INVESTMENTS is a mobile banking platform hosted in the Cloud. It is a Bank that was born on the Cloud, and thrives on the Cloud.

So move over Greatest Generation.  The Millennials now known as Cloud Computing Generation has arrived.

Introducing our Team Members:
Dean Dyer, Logan Stroly, Matt Gohr, Tyler Maran, Limbert Bontigao – we are the Technocrats.
